\section{Review:CMA-ES}
CMA-ES is a sampling-based, derivative-free evolutionary
algorithm for solving optimization problems. In each generation, $\lambda$ new
candidates are sampled from a multivariate normal distribution,
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \vc{x}_k \mytilde \vc{m} + \sigma \mathcal{N}(\vc{0},
    \mat{C}) \text{ for } k = 1 .. \lambda
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation} 
where $\vc{m}$ is a mean, $\sigma$ is a step-size, and
$\mathcal{N}(\vc{0}, \mat{C})$ is a multivariate normal 
distribution with zero mean and covariance matrix $\mat{C}$. Various
methods are introduced to recombine the new candidates with the old
samples from the previous generation. One common strategy is to create
a pool of samples that consists of $\lambda$ new samples and $\mu$ old
samples from the previous generation, and select the best $\mu$
samples from this pool. These new samples are used to update the mean
and the covariance matrix for the next generation.
