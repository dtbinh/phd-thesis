Inspired by how humans learn dynamic motor skills through progressive
process of coaching and practices, we introduce an intuitive and
interactive framework for developing dynamic controllers. The user
only needs to provide 
a primitive initial controller and
high-level, human-readable instructions as if
s/he is coaching a human trainee, while the character has the ability
to interpret the abstract instructions, accumulate the knowledge from
the coach, and improve its skill iteratively. We introduce ``control
rigs'' as an intermediate layer of control module to facilitate the
mapping between high-level instructions and low-level control
variables. Control rigs also utilize the human coach's knowledge to
reduce the search space for control optimization. In addition, we
develop a new sampling-based optimization method, Covariance Matrix
Adaptation with Classification (CMA-C), to efficiently compute control
rig parameters. Based on the observation of human ability to ``learn
from failure'', CMA-C utilizes the failed simulation trials to
approximate an infeasible region in the space of control rig
parameters, resulting a faster convergence for the CMA
optimization.

We demonstrate the design process of complex dynamic
controllers using our framework, including precision jumps, turnaround
jumps, monkey vaults, drop-and-rolls, and wall-backflips.
