\chapter{Introduction}
Dynamic human motions are beautiful and fundamental skills in sports,
martial arts, and everyday life.
Importance of dynamic motor skills are well described in the philosophy of
Parkour, “an art of overcoming obstacles as swiftly and efficiently as
possible using only your body”.
As stated, dynamic motor skills can be ways of self-expression or
efficient mechanisms of transportation and manipulation.
Beyond the fact that highly dynamic controllers are a great milestone, 
it is a promising method to maximize virtual characters and real robots
capability for challenging tasks.
In computer games, characters with dynamic motion controllers can 
lively respond to user interactions and show optimal behaviors 
by minimizing energy consumption in the physically simulated environment.
In robotics, a rich set of dynamic motor skills can give more freedom of
movements to the robot in the uneven terrain of the disaster places.

In this dissertation, development of physics-based controllers involves
two types of subjects: virtual characters and real humanoids.
Since the control problems in two domains have shared properties, such as
non-linearity, high-dimension, and discontinuity, algorithms and principles
developed in one domain can be transferred to the other domain.
However, different goals and assumptions in two domains often lead to
slightly different approaches.
The primary goal of the physics-based control in computer animation is to
generate natural and realistic human behaviors.
For this goal, a wide range of controllers have been developed for highly
dynamic stunts in the level of athletes, such as leaping, vaulting, and
flipping under the assumption that a character has enough agility to execute such motions.
On the other hand, a humanoid controller in the robotics must be compatible 
with the hardware, which generally has more conservative joints and torques
limitations.
Furthermore, robustness of the controller becomes a more important issue
because a fall can potentially cause detrimental damage to the robot and
enormous cost to repair.

However, developing effective controllers is a very difficult and
time-consuming task.
First, a design process for controllers require a lot of prior knowledge
including mechanisms, target poses, momenta, and contacts.
One promising direction to acquire prior knowledge is a paradigm of
``learning from demonstration''[], which still requires careful
generalization techniques for robust control.
Another difficulty arises when optimizing the parameters for the controllers.
Usually, whole-body dynamic tasks typically have a cost function that is 
multimodal and very non-smooth due to the combined challenge of contact 
switches, dynamic balance, and high-dimensional space.
Further, most control parameters will lead to undesired behaviors such as
losing balance or unexpected contacts.
These difficulties often requires the most robust optimization algorithm, 
CMA-ES, which is designed for non-linear non-convex black-box
optimizations.
In addition, training policies for hardware adds another problem.
Although a simulator is a useful tool that provides fast evaluations of the
controllers, but controllers turned in simulation do not work on hardware due
to the differences in two systems, so called simulation bias.
One way to alleviate simulation bias is iteratively updating the simulation
model [,,], so called model-based policy search, which is an on-going topic in
robotics.

In this dissertation, following problems are identified for developing 
controllers for highly dynamic motor skills.

\section{Falling Strategies for Humanoids}
Highly dynamic motions often accompany the abrupt momentum changes, which can
cause large contact forces to characters.
Therefore, how to manage falls is a fundamental motor skill to reduce damages
to humanoids and achieve fluent transitions between motor skills.
I will present two falling strategies for falls of virtual and real humanoids,
which are inspired by falling of Traceurs (Parkour practitioners) and robots.
The effectiveness of the presented strategies will be validated in physics
simulation, and experimentally tested on a small-size humanoid.

\subsection{Falling and Landing Motion Control for Virtual Characters}
In Chapter 3, I will show how to create an on-line controller for generating 
agile and natural falling motions of the virtual character that can land from 
various heights and velocities.
Inspired by falling skills of Parkour, I will formulate the falling scenario
with three phases, airborne, impact, and rolling based on the contact states 
of the character.
Two controllers are designed for airborne and rolling phases and a regression
analysis is conducted to find an optimal impact angle that can connect two
controllers.
Finally, I will demonstrate that the algorithm induces smaller joint stress,
which is still four times lower than a rag-doll motion at the worst cases.

\subsection{Multiple Contact Planning for Humanoids}
Chapter 4 will provide an introduction on a multiple contact planning to
reduce the damage to the real humanoid, which provides a unified framework
for the existing falling techniques [,,].
Then, I will show how to efficiently optimize the multiple contact falling
strategy to the given initial state using a simplified model and dynamic 
programming.
Finally, various scenarios will be tested on simulated humanoids and the
actual hardware to show that our algorithm plans various falling strategies
with different contact sequences.

\section{Learning of Dynamic Controller for Characters}
Teaching a physically simulated character a new motor skill entirely depends 
on the effort of the controller designer, from the design of the control 
architecture to the tweaking of low-level control parameters.
To simplify the learning process, we introduce an intuitive and 
interactive framework for developing dynamic controllers that is inspired by
how humans learn dynamic motor skills through progressive process of coaching
and practices.
Further, we propose two optimization techniques that can expedite the convergence and generalize the skill to the parametrized objectives.

\subsection{Iterative Design of Dynamic Controllers}
In Chapter 5, I will describe a general framework to design dynamic
controllers using high-level, human-readable instructions.
In this framework, we introduce a “control rig” that can control the multiple
joints at the same time, which can be easily created by a set of high level
instructions.
The details of controllers and objectives formulation using control rigs and
instructions will be shown with examples.

\subsection{Optimization with Failure Learning}
A controller with many user constraints is difficult to optimize due to the
relatively small feasible region.
In Chapter 6, I will describe a new optimization algorithm based on the
observation of human’s ability to learn from failure.
The proposed algorithm, CMA-C (Covariance Matrix Adaptation with
Classification) utilizes the failed simulation trials to approximate 
an infeasible region in the space of control rig parameters, resulting a
faster convergence than the standard CMA-ES.

\subsection{Optimization for Parametrized Motor Skills}
In Chapter 7, I will show how to optimize parametrized motor skills that are
essential for autonomous robots operating in an unpredictable environment. 
By evolving a parametrized probability distribution, the algorithm reduces 
the number of samples required to optimize a parametrized skill for 
all the tasks in the range of interest.
