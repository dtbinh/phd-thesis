\section{Conclusion}

We presented a general algorithm to minimize the damage of humanoid
falls by utilizing multiple contact points. For an initial state with
arbitrary planar momentum, our algorithm optimizes the contact
sequence using abstract models and dynamic programming. Unlike
previous methods, our algorithm automatically determines the total
number of contacts, the order of contacts, and the position and timing
of contacts, such that the initial momentum is dissipated with minimal
damage to the robot.

% For future consideration, we plan on implementing a realtime falling
% controller on a small humanoid, BioloidGP. First, the realtime
% control needs to be achieved by caching the cost-to-go function for a
% wide range of states. The robot also requires sensors to identify the
% state in realtime, such as additional IMUs or contact sensors.
