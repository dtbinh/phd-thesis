Being faster and stronger has been a great challenge for virtual and real
humanoids.
Agile motions of virtual characters are popular contents to captivate consumers
of computer animations and games.
Real humanoids also require enough agility to efficiently execute various
tasks which are difficult and dangerous to be done by human workers.
The focus of the dissertation is to develop a set of computational tools to
expedite the design process of physics-based controllers that can execute a
vareity of agile motor skills on virtual and real humanoids.
Instead of directly deploying motions on real humanoids, this disseration takes
an approach that develops appropriate theories and models on virtual simulation
and transfer the solutions to hardware systems with careful adjustments.

The algorithms and frameworks in this dissertation cover various topics from
specific physics-based controllers to general learning frameworks.
We first present an online algorithm for controlling falling and landing
motions of virtual characters.
The proposed algorithm is effective and efficient enough to generate falling
motions for a wide range of arbitrary initial conditions in real-time.
Next, we present a robust falling strategy for real humanoids that can manage
a wide range of perturbations by planning the optimal contact sequences.
We then introduce an iterative learning framework to intuitively design various
agile motions, which is inspired by human learning techniques.
The proposed iterative framework is followed by novel algorithms to
efficiently optimize control parameters for the target tasks, especially when
they have many constraints or parameterized goals.
Finally, we introduce an iterative approach for exporting simulation-optimized
control policies to hardware of robots to reduce the number of hardware
experiments, that usually accompanies expensive costs and labors.
