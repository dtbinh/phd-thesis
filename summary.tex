Demonstrating strength and agility on virtual and real humanoids has
been an important goal in computer graphics and robotics.
However, developing physics-based controllers for various agile motor skills
requires a tremendous amount of prior knowledge and manual labor due to
complex mechanisms \revised{of motor skills}.
The focus of the dissertation is to develop a set of computational tools to
expedite the design process of physics-based controllers that can execute a
variety of agile motor skills on virtual and real humanoids.
Instead of directly deploying \revised{controllers} on real humanoids, this
dissertation takes an approach that develops appropriate theories and models in
virtual simulation and systematically transfers the solutions to hardware systems.

The algorithms and frameworks in this dissertation span various topics from
specific physics-based controllers to general learning frameworks.
We first present an online algorithm for controlling falling and landing
motions of virtual characters.
The proposed algorithm is effective and efficient enough to generate falling
motions for a wide range of arbitrary initial conditions in real-time.
Next, we present a robust falling strategy for real humanoids that can manage
a wide range of perturbations by planning the optimal contact sequences.
We then introduce an iterative learning framework to \revised{easily} design
various agile motions, which is inspired by human learning techniques.
The proposed framework is followed by novel algorithms to
efficiently optimize control parameters for the target tasks, especially when
they have many constraints or parameterized goals.
Finally, we introduce an iterative approach for exporting simulation-optimized
control policies to hardware of robots to reduce the number of hardware
experiments, that accompany expensive costs and labors.
